    <p> The mission of the Seattle Academy Robotics program is to offer curious students a place to learn foundational skills in building, coding, design, and business administration. For students that want to excel and commit more time, they will have an opportunity to explore high engineering problems and advanced coding techniques. We believe deeply in a student-run program with mentors to give support and vision. Students select from various proficiency building sub-groups that include but are not limited to coding, precision fabrication, Computer Aided Design (CAD), business & marketing, and more.
